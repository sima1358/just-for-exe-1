        spring. The spring also waters the vast lush lands of Niasar. The
        bedrock that made the water passage of Niasar Waterfall is usually made

      <p>Khalednabi</p>
      <p>
        In the stunning green hills of Northern Iran, one cemetery is covered in
        headstones distinctly resembling male and female genitalia. Some are
        cylindrical and capped, while others are paired and rounded. All told,
        the cemetery has a total of 600 monuments to sex organs sprawling across
        the vibrant landscape. Khalid Nabi Cemetery is a little-known place in
        90 km northeast of the city of Gonbad-e kavous, famous for its ancient
        tombs and special gravestones.In a country known for its strict
        religious law, a cemetery dotted with varying-sized penis and breast
        shaped headstones tends to stand out. Visitors can immediately tell that
        the cemetery was created in a far different era. Close to the border
        with Turkmenistan, some experts suggest that the cemetery was created by
        phallus worshipping peoples from Central Asia and India, although
        conclusive proof of this does not exist. Little scholarship has occurred
        on the cemetery’s origins within Iran because of a strong national
        embarrassment over the suggestive stones. There is little publicity over
        the cemetery and most scholars have strayed from studying the historic
        area.The Khalid Nabi cemetery and tomb complex consists of several
        pilgrimage sites as well as a historic cemetery. Located in the
        highlands and mountainous areas of Golestan province, it is the burial
        site of Khalid Nabi (the ancient prophet) as well as numerous small and
        large stone statues. All of these factors, along with the spectacular
        landscapes of the surrounding countryside, have made this area an
        important tourist attraction in the north of the country.Khalid Nabi is
        an Arab Prophet who used to live 40 years before the Prophet Muhammad
        (peace be upon him). Khalid ibn Sanan, known among Turkmen as Khalid
        Nabi (Prophet Khalid), was born in the land of Aden in Yemen. According
        to the historical documents, he is one of the four prophets who lived
        between the time of Jesus Christ and the Prophet of Islam. During the
        Sassanid rule over Iran, Khalid Nabi fled to this site to avoid
        government agent .Since Khalid Nabi is popular and respected among the
        Turkmen people, alongside the mausoleum, a number of rooms and small
        hostels and a mosque are built for pilgrims to stay and relax. It is
        mainly situated on a mountain ridge about 1 km distance from the
        mausoleum called “Khaled Nabi” who according to oral tradition of the
        Yomut Turkomans was a pre-Islamic prophet and whose mausoleum is visited
        by them for pilgrimage together with the neighbouring one of Ata Chofun
        (“Father Shepherd”), his son-in-law. The cemetery was visited in 1979
        and 1980 by the archeologist David Stronach. He found over 600 standing
        stones which are spread out in several locations. About half of them are
        on the ridge which he calls “High Plateau” South and south-east of that
        are small groups of stones on several other ridges and hillocks. At some
        distance there is another group of perhaps 150 stones which are
        distributed over a wide area on the south side of the mountain.

      <p>Mesr Desert</p>
      <p>
        Mesr is desert and also an oasis located in the central desert of Iran,
        (known as Dashte-Kavir in Persian). The central mountain ranges of Iran
        which are predominantly isolated oasis type mountains which run through
        the desert territory of Iran, are close by. The town’s only water source
        and therefore lifeline comes from a spring that flows out of the
        foothills of the aforementioned mountains quite close to the heart of
        the village. This is the only source of life for the gardens and date
        palm orchards that make this oasis such a special place. Watching
        sunsets and stars are very encouraged in this region.Reaching Mesr is
        easy, although you need to change direction several times from major
        cities of Iran, around 250 kilometers drive onto the Naein-Tabas road
        from Esfahan west to east. After passing Farokhi and Nasrabad villages,
        there is a sign showing off-road direction: ” Toward Mesr.” All in all,
        it is 420 km from Isfahan. Upon 43 kilometers drive from the sign across
        the sand hills, 3 green spots will appear from far, similar to three
        emeralds next to each other. Few moments later, while the absolute
        silence of desert is your only company, you will find yourself in the
        first emerald land, Amirabad. The road is totally flat which is
        considered as one of the wonders of Iran’s central desert and surprises
        every Eco-tourist. The sand hills around the village are known as
        thrones since the strong wind has shaped the surface, forming strange
        and attractive figures. By BUS, it is possible to reach Khur, which is
        around 50 km from Mesr. There are buses to Khur from Isfahan (every day
        at 1 pm from Kaveh terminal, taavune 4, 205000 IRR) and from Yazd once a
        day. Some buses between Mashhad and Tehran also stop in Khur at night.
        Ask locally about the times and prices. From Khur to Mesr taxi is the
        only option. You can call your accommodation in advance to have a taxi
        driver wait for you or you can just charter one when you arrive. The
        price is 400000 IRR for the whole car (2016). Tens of millions of years
        ago, the dry Dasht-e Kavir land was occupied by a salt-rich ocean that
        surrounded a small piece of the continent that is now considered to be
        central Iran. As the ocean dried up, it left behind a salt layer as much
        as 6 to 7 kilometers thick. Over time, the salt was covered by mud, but
        its power made it push through over the years and created the salt domes
        in this desert, which is definitely a unique phenomenon worth exploring
        while you are in Iran! The wonders of this ancient ocean and current
        desert are quite indescribable! From the silent serenity of the desert
        to the villages built by resilient people in the desert land over time,
        there is so much to see! This Iran tour package is designed to show you
        the modernity of cities like Tehran, the calmness of the sandhills, and
        the uniqueness of Tabas villages along our way to get to one of the
        unique desert cities in the world, Yazd. In IranAmaze Iran travel agency
        We’ll experience the diversity along the path of Dasht-E Kavir while
